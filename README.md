## Project Idea and Working

Using data analytics to help customers as well as the industry to take informed decisions.

### Backend:-

1. Node (NodeJS)

Node allows to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.

In my node file, the controller node is where most of the shared OpenStack services and other tools run. The Controller node supplies API, scheduling, and other shared services for the cloud.

The model you define in the Node.js server (model node) is an abstraction of the data in your MongoDB database, which is represented as a document. Because of this abstraction, you may use the “Mongoose” schemas to construct a blueprint of how you want the added data to look and behave.


2. MongoDB Compass

I used the MongoDB Compass desktop application to go through the data stored in my MongoDB database. 

The database was created on the basis of the dataset provided by the Data Analysis Engage challenge and after data cleaning.


3. Postman

I used Postman for API building and testing.

Postman Documentation: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21119224/UyxqC3wT


The APIs developed will be used to compare several specifications of cars and perform data visualization (demand of the problem statement).

Few of the API examples: 
i. Get all cars data
ii. Companies vs no. of cars
iii. Avg price vs power
